# Display your favorite movie posters
This small php application pulls movie titles from a text file (movies-list.txt, located in the resources folder) and displays the corresponding posters by sending requests to the http://www.omdbapi.com movie database API.
# Note
Make sure to run the index.php file on a virtualhost (wampserver) to ensure that javascript can use the XMLHttpRequest() method for retrieving the API data.
